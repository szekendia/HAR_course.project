# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
## Johns Hopkins University - Getting and Cleaning data Course project Readme

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:
* a tidy data set,
* a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## The content of the repository
* Tidy data set: __means_by_activity_and_subject.txt__
* R script: __run_analysis.R__
* Code book: __CodeBook.md__
* __README.md__

### means_by_activity_and_subject.txt
* Tidy data set with the average of each _mean_ and _standard_ deviation variable for each activity and each subject.
* The data set is cross-tab generated by _summarise {plyr}_
* Written by run_analysis.R

### run_analysis.R
* The R script downloads and extract the project's data set to the _"./Week03_CourseProject"_ subdirectory under the working directory
* Loads and merges the training (train) and test data set from the required data files
* Cleans the field names based on the original feature list
* Filters the data set to contain only mean and standard deviation measurements
* Loads and merges the test and training inertial signals
* Joins relevant data.frames in order to decode IDs
* Summarises each measures by Activity and Subject
* Output: means_by_activity_and_subject.txt
> Run the script:
> * download the script to the working directory: __source("run_analysis.R")__
> * use the script from the public repository: __source("https://github.com/szekendia/HAR_course.project/blob/master/run_analysis.R")__

### CodeBook.md
The code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
